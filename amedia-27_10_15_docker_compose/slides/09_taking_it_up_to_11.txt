% Going one step further

* Wouldn't it be great if we could develop inside docker containers?

* The magic DNS container comes to the rescue again

* Defining a docker-compose.yml for each app locally it's easy

* Just map the local app directory to where the code lives in production in the container

* Run ~docker-compose up~ in the app-directory and it'll just work

* This requires a tiny bit of magic in the docker-compose.yml file, but not much
